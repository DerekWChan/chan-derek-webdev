# About Me

I am currently a senior undergraduate student at Northeastern. I've been on three co-ops - Cengage Learning, Placester, and HubSpot. I have a pretty good grasp of languages at all levels, but I mainly prefer to use Python and JavaScript. I have solid work experience on the frontend, but am looking to become more versed in full stack development. In the previous semester, Spring 2017, I took [CS3200] Database Design, in which I constructed a realty help web app. 
 
# chan-derek-webdev

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a place where I can store the source code for [CS4550] Web Development's assignments. By putting my work up on GitHub, the professor and the class' TAs can properly review and grade it.
